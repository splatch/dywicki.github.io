      <description>One of most annoying things these days is managing CI/CD with multiple repositories. For quite long time github didn&amp;rsquo;t offer private repositories while gitlab did. This lead to situation where people been asking gitlab for additional features. One of these is support for mirroring git repositories from github to gitlab just to run pipelines. I happened to have the same requirement.</description>

      <description>Over past couple of months I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with gitlab ci as it brings a bit of refreshing breeze after years of struggle with Jenkins. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I value what Jenkins did for us over past decade. I just think that maintenance of it is a bit of nightmare.
