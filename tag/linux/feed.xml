      <description>It is not a secret that Linux can juggle USB serial ports between restarts. This is something which doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen on linux, but if you ever looked at internet forums on how to fix issue, you for sure found advice to use custom udev rules.</description>

      <title>Kubernets TLS secret with ca.crt field for mtls</title>

      <description>By default kubernetes tls secret must consist two fields a &lt;code&gt;tls.key&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tls.crt&lt;/code&gt;. It works perfectly fine in most of the cases, but not when we need mutual tls which is handled by ingress-nginx. This kind of ingress requires a secret with a &amp;ldquo;ca.crt&amp;rdquo; field to validate client certs. Obviously it tricks a kubectl which can&amp;rsquo;t append more than standard.</description>

      <title>Migration from OSX to Arch Linux</title>
      <link>https://dywicki.pl/2018/08/migration-from-osx-to-arch-linux/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is already 12 months since I started using my (first since very long time) desktop PC. In my previous blog post I&amp;rsquo;ve described reasons why I decided to resign from Apple hardware. In this one I will tell you how I managed to drop OSX and its ecosystem with minor pains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that I owe you also some insights - which applications I had to swap and which I was lucky to keep. Because I work with Java on daily basis I do not have any major troubles with portability of my software, however just few out many programs is actually written in Java.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why I abandoned Apple and OSX for Linux</title>

      <description>I must start from small confession. I am not an computer kido. My first computer was AMD K6 with 266 Hz clock I got for Christmas back in 1999. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in my life Amiga, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t part of long standing battle between platforms. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen Norton Commander on my friend PC who got his Pentium in 95, but I never had to run such tool on my own. Point of bringing whole history of myself coming to computers is to show you that I am relatively fresh to it.</description>
