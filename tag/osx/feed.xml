      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is already 12 months since I started using my (first since very long time) desktop PC. In my previous blog post I&amp;rsquo;ve described reasons why I decided to resign from Apple hardware. In this one I will tell you how I managed to drop OSX and its ecosystem with minor pains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that I owe you also some insights - which applications I had to swap and which I was lucky to keep. Because I work with Java on daily basis I do not have any major troubles with portability of my software, however just few out many programs is actually written in Java.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
