      <description>One of most annoying things these days is managing CI/CD with multiple repositories. For quite long time github didn&amp;rsquo;t offer private repositories while gitlab did. This lead to situation where people been asking gitlab for additional features. One of these is support for mirroring git repositories from github to gitlab just to run pipelines. I happened to have the same requirement.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&#34;http://wireshark.org/&#34;&gt;Wireshark&lt;/a&gt; is outstanding piece of software. I had few chances to make use of it, early in my IT days, then in one of bigger projects I worked on, and finally now - when I began working on industrial integration protocols.{{ double-space-with-newline }}This blog post will describe a journey I had with Wireshark over last couple of weeks and tell you why clicking couple of times everywhere you &lt;em&gt;CAN&lt;/em&gt; is sometimes better.</description>

      <title>Migration from OSX to Arch Linux</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is already 12 months since I started using my (first since very long time) desktop PC. In my previous blog post I&amp;rsquo;ve described reasons why I decided to resign from Apple hardware. In this one I will tell you how I managed to drop OSX and its ecosystem with minor pains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that I owe you also some insights - which applications I had to swap and which I was lucky to keep. Because I work with Java on daily basis I do not have any major troubles with portability of my software, however just few out many programs is actually written in Java.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why I abandoned Apple and OSX for Linux</title>

      <description>I must start from small confession. I am not an computer kido. My first computer was AMD K6 with 266 Hz clock I got for Christmas back in 1999. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in my life Amiga, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t part of long standing battle between platforms. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen Norton Commander on my friend PC who got his Pentium in 95, but I never had to run such tool on my own. Point of bringing whole history of myself coming to computers is to show you that I am relatively fresh to it.</description>
